      <h1>Kevin Rosas</h1>
      <p>
        I've always been interested in two vastly different fields, computers
        and the arts. Therefore, my goal in life is to master both.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since highschool, I have consistently dabbled in C# (because of my
        childhood dream of becoming a video game developer) and have also
        participated in my school's film program (because of my OTHER dream of
        becoming a film director).
      </p>
      <p>
        Nowadays, I spend most of my time trying to learn and create projects in
        C#, Python, HTML, and CSS so that I can be better equiped for real world
        opportunities. On the flipside, I'll unwind by writing some scripts,
        editing some videos, or help out on someone's film production.
      </p>
      <p>I have an Associate's degree in Film from Orange Coast College</p>
